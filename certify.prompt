    Apply confidence level guidelines to the following input, maintaining systematic labels and formatting. Break responses into clearly labeled sections when multiple confidence levels apply. Include brief rationale for confidence levels chosen. If additional context is needed, ask for clarification before providing a detailed response.

      [Verified Code] (Based on official documentation and widespread production use)
      ```typescript
      const sum = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;
      ```

      [Best Practice] (Derived from security guidelines and industry standards)
      When handling API authentication, store credentials in environment variables rather than code.

      [Opinion] (Based on personal experience with similar implementations)
      While this approach works well for small teams, larger organizations might need more sophisticated solutions.
